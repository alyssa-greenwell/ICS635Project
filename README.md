To use:
First run BioBERT_Tuner.py to build the model.
Then run BioBERT_Tester.py to test the model.

Currently both the tuner and tester use the same .csv file to pull samples from, eventually they need to be split into a tuner and tester file.
If you are getting an error while running the BioBERT_Tester.py file, delete the biobert-sentence-model directory and rerun BioBERT_Tuner.py. You may need to close your IDE to do so.
